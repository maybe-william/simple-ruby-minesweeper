I'm a self-taught Computer Scientist of 10 years. As a generalist, my interests include a wide variety of things, both in computer science and in other areas of life, and this has resulted in a broad exploration of computers in general.

##About this project
This project was originally a self-imposed challenge to build a working game of minesweeper on a terminal in under an hour. After being successful in that challenge, I decided that I would like to try to improve the simple version of the game with extra features.

##Challenges encountered
- Coding the basic version in under 1 hour
- A bug with calculating the number of mines around a square
